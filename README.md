# Multi4Channels

Multi4Channels is a Python-based application that creates a 2x2 mosaic video stream from up to four Channels DVR channels, streamed via RTP to Channels DVR for viewing as a single channel (e.g., `ch199`). The web interface allows users to select channels, manage favorites, and start/stop the stream. The project runs in a Docker container using host networking for seamless integration with Channels DVR on the same machine.

## Features
- **Mosaic Streaming**: Combines up to four Channels DVR streams into a 2x2 grid, output as a single H.264 video stream.
- **Web UI**: Responsive interface for selecting channels, starting streams, and managing favorites, accessible on mobile or desktop.
- **Favorites**: Save and quickly select favorite channels from the Channels DVR M3U playlist.
- **Graceful Stream Switching**: Cleanly terminates existing streams before starting new ones to avoid conflicts.
- **Host Mode**: Runs in Docker with `--network host` for direct communication with Channels DVR.
- **Auto-Stop**: Stops the stream after 6 minutes of inactivity on the target channel (configurable).

## Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Installed on the host machine (tested with Docker 20.10+).
- **Channels DVR**: Running on the same host (default: `http://192.168.1.152:8089`).
- **VLC**: Included in the Docker image for stream processing.
- **Network**: Host machine and Channels DVR must be on the same network (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
- **Background Image**: `app/photos/bg.jpg` (included) for the mosaic background.

## Project Structure


2. Configure Channels DVR
•  Log into Channels DVR (e.g., http://192.168.1.152:8089).
•  Go to Settings > Sources and add a custom M3U source for the mosaic stream:
	•  Name: multi4channels (or any name, e.g., for ch199).
	•  Choose Text in the drop down and copy paste changing channel number from 240 to what you want as the channel number.  Also change -docker.machine.ip- to the actual numbers. 

 ```bash
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:0, channel-id="M4C" tvg-id="240" tvg-chno="240" tvc-guide-placeholders="7200" tvc-guide-title="Start a Stream At docker.machine.ip:9799..” tvc-guide-description="Visit Multi4Channels Web Page to Start a Stream (docker.machine.ip:9799).” tvc-guide-art="https://i.postimg.cc/xCy2v22X/IMG-3254.png"  tvg-logo="https://i.postimg.cc/xCy2v22X/IMG-3254.png" tvc-guide-stationid="" tvg-name="Multi4Channels" group-title="HD", M4C 
udp://127.0.0.1:4444
 ```
Enter a starting channel number and select ignore channel number from m3u if you didn’t change in the text above. Leave the xmltv guide block blank and click save. 

3. Create a Volume for Favorites 
To persist favorite channels:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/multi4channels/app
touch ~/multi4channels/app/favorites.json
chmod 666 ~/multi4channels/app/favorites.json
```

Pull the Docker Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/rice9797/multi4channels:v1
```

4. Run the Container
Run the container in host mode with environment variables:

``` bash 
docker run -d --name multi4channels --restart unless-stopped --network host \
  -e CDVR_HOST=192.168.1.152 \
  -e CDVR_PORT=8089 \
  -e CDVR_CHNLNUM=240 \
  -e OUTPUT_FPS=60 \
  -e RTP_HOST=192.168.1.152 \
  -e RTP_PORT=4444 \
  -e WEB_PAGE_PORT=9799\
  -v ~/multi4channels/app/favorites.json:/app/favorites.json \
  ghcr.io/rice9797/multi4channels:v1
```

Environment Variables:

IMPORTANT:   -e CDVR_CHNLNUM=240 \ is used to monitor the channels dvr api to watch for activity in the channels you choose to watch multiview on. When you stop watching the channel a 6 minute countdown begins and if the channel is not tuned again within 6 minutes the transcoding stops. USE this!!

CDVR_HOST= use the ip of your Channels dvr machine 

RTP_PORT= this is the stream output port and can be changed if 4444 is in use. 

OUTPUT_FPS= 25,30,50,60 should all work for choosing your desired frames per second. 

WEB_PAGE_PORT=9799 Change to desired port or if 9799 is in use. 

Notes:
•  --network host: Ensures the container can communicate with Channels DVR on 127.0.0.1:4444.
•  -v $(pwd)/app:/app: Mounts the app directory for persistent changes and favorites.
•  If CDVR_CHNLNUM is unset, the inactivity check is disabled.
Usage
1. Access the Web UI
•  Open a browser on your device (e.g., iPhone or computer) and navigate to: docker.host.ip:9799
•  The UI displays four input boxes for channel numbers, a “Start Stream” button, and a favorites list.
2. Start a Stream
•  Enter up to four channel numbers (e.g., 6101, 6073, 6080, 6070) from Channels DVR’s M3U playlist.
•  Tap “Start Stream” and confirm the pop-up notification.
•  In Channels DVR, tune to ch199 (Multi4x) to view the 2x2 mosaic stream.
•  Audio is sourced from the second channel (ch2).
3. Change Channels
•  Return to the web UI, enter new channel numbers, and tap “Start Stream.”
•  The existing stream stops, and the new stream starts within 5–10 seconds.
•  Channels DVR will require exiting the channel and restarting the channel. The channel doesn't seem to ever recover thus a back out and restart of the channel is required.
4. Manage Favorites
•  Click the hamburger menu (☰) and select “Available Channels.”
•  Add/remove favorites by clicking the heart icon (♥/♡) next to each channel.
•  Favorites appear in the main UI for quick selection.
•  Favorites are saved to /app/favorites.json and persist across container restarts.
5. Stop the Stream
•  The stream stops automatically after 6 minutes if ch199 is not being watched (if CDVR_CHNLNUM=199).


Limitations
•  Host Mode Only: Currently configured for --network host. Bridge mode may require additional network configuration and code changes. 
•  Channels DVR Dependency: Requires Channels DVR on the same host with accessible streams.
•  Single Audio Source: Only ch2’s audio is included in the mosaic.
•  Stream Switching: Channels DVR will require reloading the channel, it will not recover on its own.

Future Improvements
•  Support bridge mode.  I would love to figure out how to run this in bridge mode but the stream output breaks everytime I try.  Can you help?

Latest Improvements
v2 tag includes the following:
- Added an End Current Stream option in the menu button.  Stream will still auto kill after channel is closed when using the enviornment variable but the kill button is there if you wabt to use it.
- Significantly reduced CPU consumption with code tweaks.
- Added logic to identify and use Intel QuickSync for hardware encoding if available. Currently un-tested and un-verified as working. 
- Added WEB_PAGE_PORT= variable to be able to change port number for the web ui page.
